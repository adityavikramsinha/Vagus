## Git and GitHub

### Branch Naming

- `feat/`  : for a new feature
- `fix/`   : for major issue
- `dev/`   : for development related actions.

_Optionally_, if a ticket/issue exists then
just use that as the name of the branch,
it's just easier like that instead of continuously
making up names or.
