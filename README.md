### Welcome, to the Vagus Readme Page

This project has been created for fun, lol.
It tries to visualise a lot of the common algorithms in graphs and shortest path detection problems.
This is basically in a sense, a "maze solver". However, it does not strive to take **just** the path that joins two points but, the most optimal path too. This is why, a host of different algorithms have been provided.
Thus, it is a tool through which one can **visualise** the algorithms used to find optimal or sub-optimal or required paths joining a number of points.
